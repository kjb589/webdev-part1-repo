# About Me
My name is KJ Butler, and I am from the Pearl River community on the Choctaw reservation in Philadelphia, MS. I am senior at Mississippi State University. I am majoring in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. I am currently in Capstone Design I as part of my ECE curriculum and my team is Team Quebec. We are working on Ison - a pair of smart reading glasses which is designed to help those with visual impairments or learning disorders.
